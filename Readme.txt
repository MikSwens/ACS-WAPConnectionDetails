This program is a tool to enhance the IBM i Access Client Solutions Windows Application Package.  That Windows binary package does not have a graphical interface to create or modify connection details.  The command line tool that is provided with it is quite limited in what it can do.  This tool is designed to fill that gap.  It can be used to modify the attributes of existing connection definitions, remove them, or add new connections.  When run as administrator, the tool will allow you to modify the connection definitions for any of the locally defined Windows users.  
When run as administrator you can also use the tool to add or update the service file entries in the Windows service file for the host servers used by the client.
